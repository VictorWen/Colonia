# Colonia Game
 A Fusion of Strategy, Tactics, and Fantasy
 (Still in **very** early development, started in late August 2020)
 
## Goals
There are two major goals with this project:
1. Create a fun and interesting game
2. Learn about OOP structure and design

To accomplish the first goal, a game proposal was required to help flesh out the snippets of ideas from my head. This can be viewed below.
To accomplish the second goal, the game code is written with many OOP "best practices" in mind. The codebase is/will be designed so that new features can easily be added to the game, even multiplayer.

## Game Proposal
The game is based off an earlier project of mine called Colonia. This new version of Colonia hopes of expanding upon my earlier work and trying new things.
